# Recommender-System
I have used the dataset of Pune Zomato restaurants from kaggle and have made a recommender system for Zomato(Pune)
Initially I have dealt with the null values using backward-fill & forward-fill 
After the data was ready , I did some basic text processing like - removing punctuations , removing stopwords and lowercasing the alphabets .
I've made the recommender system on the principle of cosine-similarity .
